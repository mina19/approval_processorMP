Hi. Welcome.
These are instructions for testing approval_processorMP's pipeline throttler.
The idea is to ignore events from specific group/pipeline/searches when 
specific pipelines are overproducing events.

What approval_processorMP will do upon receipt of a "new" type lvalert is
see if there is a PipelineThrottle QueueItem with the throttleKey formed
by the group/pipeline/search combination.

It will either add the event to an already existing PipelineThrottle or create
a new one and add it to the events tracker there.

From the child-Config-approval_processorMP.ini file, it will know what the
targetRate and window for tracking should be, and what the number threshold 
should be by computing this value. Depending on the value of requireManualReset,
the PipelineThrottle will forever remained throttled once throttled (requiring
using the command resetThrottle) or it will sort itself out and become 
unthrottled if we wait long enough and the pipeline calms down.

Thus to test, we need to start an lvalertTest_listenMP listener.

1. Call setupTestListener.sh
   It will ask for your email address and your LIGO ID
   You can specify a testing directory where it will download the repo's as 
   needed for testing
   ex: ./setupTestListener.sh -d /home/min-a.cho/github

2. Calling setupTestListener.sh above created two new files in the newly
   created approval_processorMP/test/pipelineThrottle directory called
   repoDir.txt and setup.sh

3. The test we conduct will be as follows:
   1. Simulate 3 CBC_gstlal_LowMass events, send lvalerts for these --
      this will trip the pipeline throttle for this throttleKey.
      Make sure these events become labeled as EM_Throttled
   2. Send a resetThrottle command using resetThrottleTest.sh
      It is very import you own a testing lvalert node that you can publish to!
      ex: min-a.cho-test or deep.chatterjee-test
      It should be of the form ${LIGO_NAME}-test
   3. Send another gstlal_LowMass event and make sure it is not throttled.

The results will be in the log file that you specify in the childConfig.ini's
log_directory under the [general] heading.

Good luck!
